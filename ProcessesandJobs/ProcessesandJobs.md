Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:

```

Ran ps aux to list current processes in the terminal, got the name of challenge, found flag by running it


## What I learned
ps -ef and ps aux are used to list processes.
-e means every process and -f means full format so combine them to get -ef

Found PID using ps -e and then I used it to kill /challenge/donâ€™t_run
Then ran /challenge/run

## What I learned
To use the kill command to stop processes

# 3.	Interrupting Processes
To interrupt a program from running and make it cleanly exit

``` bash 
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Et-ejZcqDZ7j5i0sGrIuTCZr6Ef.QXzQDO0wSM1gjNzEzW}
```
Ran /challenge/run , then used Ctrl C to interrupt it

## What I learned
Ctrl C is used to interrupt programs and stop them from running

background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

Used ctrl z to suspend run program, ran it again in the terminal to get the flag
## What I learned
Ctrl Z can be used to suspend a currently running program. It is less drastic than Ctrl C.

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to

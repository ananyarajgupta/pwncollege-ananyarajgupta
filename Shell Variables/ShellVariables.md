# 1.	Printing Variables
To print variables in shell

## My solve

**Flag:** ` pwn.college{kJ14bYG-_5Cm_2pFf0GVrGEhOFZ.QX3UTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}`
``` bash 
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{kJ14bYG-_5Cm_2pFf0GVrGEhOFZ.QX3UTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}

# 2.	Setting Variables
To give values to variables

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{kI5Dbi1jHUXni5vOqwkKwTb8dUP.QX5UTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}`
``` bash 
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{kI5Dbi1jHUXni5vOqwkKwTb8dUP.QX5UTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}
```

Gave the value to VAR and got the flag

## What I learned
to give value to variables, do it without spaces , otherwise command line will think itâ€™s a command

# 3.	Multiword Variables
To set multiword variables

## My solve

**Flag:** ` pwn.college{crBWvktFWq6q3wth8z_xyYNVLqA.QXwYTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}`
``` bash 
Connected!
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{crBWvktFWq6q3wth8z_xyYNVLqA.QXwYTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}
```
Put the value as it is multiword under quotes

## What I learned
To set a multi-word token as the value to varable use dounble quotes, other wise command line will think when it encounters a space that things written after space are command

# 4.	Exporting Variables
to export variables to other commands

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{gDFXmcCvGbZP8RGCqAPCXrAcgD0.QXyYTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}`
``` bash 
Connected!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ COLLEGE=PWN
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ export PWN
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ /chhalenge/run
bash: /chhalenge/run: No such file or directory
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ /challenge/run
CORRECT!
You have exported PWN=COLLEGE and set, but not exported, COLLEGE=PWN. Great
job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gDFXmcCvGbZP8RGCqAPCXrAcgD0.QXyYTN0wSM1gjNzEzW}
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
```

Exported PWN variable and not command variable and got the value

## What I learned
Variables are local to shell process, they need to be exported to other commands to use them there
